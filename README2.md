## UX
### Strategy Plane
As the main objective for this plane I wanted to create a software that allowed the user to input information in the terminal when requested. This input would also be validated to ensure a correct functioning of the software itself. Based on this information provided the software would generate a result and create or update new inputs for the user until a final condition was met.
### Scope Plane
In order to follow the blueprint layed out in the strategy plane I have decided that the best way to implement them was a game. For the occasion the scope plane was defined as the type of game to run which is a "player vs cpu" type. 
### Structure Plane
Given the almost complete absence of a graphic output or normal interface for the user the structure is defined as the logic structure of the software. For this case the code is structured in an initial part that defines the initial condition of the software. Follows a series of functions that can manipulate the flow of the software based on certain conditions and in the end a general function to play the game in the correct sequence is applied.
### Skeleton Plane
This particular section could be dedicated by what shape the game takes when displayed onto the terminal. Since the terminal (and also the website deployment application) presents a series of constraints to the possibilities of the graphics the game will show itself in a mainly vertical fashion. Particularly the game will be read and played through user input and an output that will be always be readable by scrolling up or down.
### Surface Plane
## Project Goals
The main goals for this project is to create an entertaing game using the python programming language. Being this my first attempt at a project like this I have decided to implement simple features that would allow the user to experience a fluid gaming session. In addition to that the general aim was to provide game that would utilize user input to carry on the program until either the computer or the user reached a satisfactory condition (win or lose system).
### Target 
Given the almost legendary history of this game, the target audience is broadly represented by almost all ages. The game is relatively easily understood and the rules rarely create a barrier to the access of it. As a general rule of thumb I feel confident to say that this specific type of game can be played from anyone aged from 8 years old to 99+. For my version of the game the only impairment could be the language used.
