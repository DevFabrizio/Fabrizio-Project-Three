## Project Goals
The main goals for this project is to create an entertaing game using the python programming language. Being this my first attempt at a project like this I have decided to implement simple features that would allow the user to experience a fluid gaming session. In addition to that the general aim was to provide game that would utilize user input to carry on the program until either the computer or the user reached a satisfactory condition (win or lose system).
### Target 
Given the almost legendary history of this game, the target audience is broadly represented by almost all ages. The game is relatively easily understood and the rules rarely create a barrier to the access of it. As a general rule of thumb I feel confident to say that this specific type of game can be played from anyone aged from 8 years old to 99+. For my version of the game the only impairment could be the language used.
