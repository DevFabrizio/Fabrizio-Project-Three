## Project Goals
The main goals for this project is to create an entertaing game using the python programming language. Being this my first attempt at a project like this I have decided to implement simple features that would allow the user to experience a fluid gaming session. In addition to that the general aim was to provide game that would utilize user input to carry on the program until either the computer or the user reached a satisfactory condition (win or lose system).
